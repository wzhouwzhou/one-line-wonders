# One Line Wonders ![](https://travis-ci.com/wzhouwzhou/one-line-wonders.svg?branch=master)
A collection of one-line programs in various languages, performing various tasks.
**"One-Line"** is for those languages that support it; the aim is to create a runnable file the shortest a language can allow (i.e. no using ; instead of a new line and "minifying" it to be one line).

### Why?
Have some fun with coding every once in a while, and see how you can abuse the semantics of a language.

### Contributing
Anyone can contribute to this repo by opening a PR, your contribution will be open-source on Github. Don't know what to make? Try coding something that logs "Hello, world!" to the console!
